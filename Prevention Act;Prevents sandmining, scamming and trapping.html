<h2>Prevention</h2>
<h3>Sandmining</h3>
<p>
    Do not sand mine, if a player sandmines the military may be deployed
    and if itâ€™s severe the criminal may be given a fine of 1g per chunk
    affected. If the fine is not paid back within 2 weeks the amount fined will go up each week by 1g per chunk
</p>
<h3>Scams<h3>
<p>
    Do not scam people, do trades fairly. If unsure of how much
    something sells for, ask someone who is trustworthy and would know.
<p>
<h3>Trapping<h3>
<p>
    If a player traps a citizen of Sudan they will be required to give them their stuff
    back and if they have a high ranking position such as military member or minister in the nation it may be 
    removed.
